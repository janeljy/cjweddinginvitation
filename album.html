<h2>Album</h2>
<p>We will be handing out ~10 Fuji 400 ISO disposable cameras during the event, and we’d love for you to join in the fun! These little cameras are perfect for capturing the happy and even goofy moments we might miss. So, pick one up, snap some memories, and help us create a wedding album full of everyone's unique perspective. We can’t wait to see the day through your eyes - thank you for being part of it!" </p>
    <p>Check back after the reception for beautiful pictures to download!</p>
