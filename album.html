    <h2>Album</h2>
    <p>We will be handing out ~10 Fuji Quicksnap disposable cameras during the event, and we’d love for you to join in the fun!

So, pick one up, snap some memories, and help us create a wedding album full of everyone's unique perspective. We can’t wait to see the day through your eyes - thank you for being part of it!" </p>
